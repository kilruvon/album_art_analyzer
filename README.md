The album cover art is one of the factors that may attract the audience to a particular musical release.
The number of listeners directly affects the revenue that the musicians will receive.
Therefore, the artists responsible for the cover art creation must decide what contents and colors they wish to display on the art,
sometimes having nothing but a genre name.
This research proposes a solution to this problem by creating a Python-based software that analyzes existing album covers and predicts most
relevant objects and colors for the cover art. The softwareâ€™s structure consists of three main parts:
acquiring data from the database, analyzing the images, and predicting the output using machine learning algorithms.
